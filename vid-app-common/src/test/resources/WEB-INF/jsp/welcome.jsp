   The Virtual Infrastructure Deployment (VID) application allows infrastructure service deployment operators 
   to instantiate service instances and their constituent parts for Distributed service models required by the 
   internal AT&T service operations organizations that manage them, such as Mobility Network Services, 
   Netbond Services, or FlexReach Services. The models are defined by ECOMP component ASDC. The service 
   deployment operator selects the service operations owner and model that they wish to instantiate. After 
   entry of appropriate data, the operator instructs VID to direct another ECOMP component, MSO, to instantiate 
   the selected service model. Once the service instance has been instantiated, the service operator can instruct 
   VID to direct MSO to instantiate the service instance's component VNFs, VF Modules, Networks and Volume Groups. 
   The VID user can also search for, and display, existing service instances and direct the instantiation of 
   subsequent instance components.

   <h1 class="heading1"><u>About VID</u></h1>
    VID was originally developed for the October 2016 release by an integrated IT and Labs team, under the 
      direction of Steve Smokowski and Vivian Pressley.
