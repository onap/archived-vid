      "message": "Thanks for the explanation. I have resolved this by keeping the @JsonProperty and setting its access \u003d Access.WRITE. So now the dash-separated names will only be used during deserialization (json2pojo) while still supporting camelcase. As for serialization everything will work as previously - output json will have camelcase names.\nI have added additional unit tests that verify all the above ser/deser scenarios.",
